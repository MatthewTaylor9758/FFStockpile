  to fix the deleting thing that deletes the first ffsplayer with the playerId
  that it finds, just make sure to add into the route variables the league_id and
  team_id. Then you can use the "and" functionality with the comma to get only the
  ffsplayer with that playerId from that specific league and that specific team.

  to get only 50 players at a time for the available players page try using "limit"
  and "offset" for the queries. Use the "e.target.value" * 50 for the offset, which
  will be the page number the user clicked on. Then maybe use the division of how
  many players come back in the total query, and create the pages divs based on that
  total number divided by 50

 **DONE** Have to add a footer that will show up on ALL pages with my contact info.
